# Month Number

Do you struggle to understand JavaScript because `Date.getMonth()` returns a number between 0 and 11, but it would totally make more sense if it ranged from 1 to 12 instead? Well, you're not alone. Stop creating _bugs_ and start creating **profit** TODAY, with month-number!

NOW with support for getting the **fifth** month number!

## Usage

```
const {getMonthNumber, getFifthMonthNumber} = require("month-number");
const currentMonthNumOneBased = getMonthNumber();
const fifthMonthNumOneBased = getFifthMonthNumber();
```
